Please indicate the invoice\nnumber at the back of the cheque. You can mail this cheque to MY ADDRESS.\n\n\nFor bank transfer, please make the payment to BANK NAME Current Account xxxx.\n\n\nNotification for withdrawal must be submitted to benne@excelinfinity.com at least 2 weeks before\ncommencement.\n\n\nNo additional charges will be imposed if replacement is made for participant who wishes to withdraw.\n\n\nPlaces will only be secured if payment has been made (marcus to advise).\n\n\nMy intention is to secure places for people who have paid up and also a motivation for them to pay\nquickly. So say if 9 visitors have made payment. 1 slot is left. The 10th person paid by cheque or bank\ntransfer. We could go with 2 routes:\n\n\n1. Slots to be taken up when they make any payment type. The 10th person’s place is secured even\nthough the bank transfer have not been made or cheque have not been received. The 11th person could\nhave paid more quickly via credit card or paypal but was unfairly omitted.\n\n2. Slots to be taken up only when they make instant payment via credit card or paypal. The onus is now\none me. If the 10th person made the payment at 3 am in the night, I would have to quickly secure his\nplace before the 11th person manage to squeeze in and make an instant payment.\n\n\nThe free ½ day 1-1 mentoring is subject to participant’s company approval.\n\nDiscount Vouchers can only be used once per purchase","title":"Terms and Conditions"}}}}
